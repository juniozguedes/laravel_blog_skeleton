Simple Laravel Blog Skeleton made by me to start projects faster

It's all Laravel native. Got the content from Traversy's media course where they follow through Laravel's framework and Auth functionalities.

Thanks to teacher Brad and all the support from Laravel Community.

Just access the .env and set things up regarding your database, you'll be up and running with no major problems (If you server point to the public_html)
